# uv-powered Python Project Template

A Python project template built with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).
It already includes: 
- [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and formatting;
- [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/) for type checking;
- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for testing;
- [coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/) for test coverage reporting;
- [Poe the Poet](https://poethepoet.natn.io/) for task management;
- [Renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com/) configuration for automated dependency updates;
- [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/) configuration with conventional commits for automated releases to PyPI.

The template starts with a minimal package named `uv_python_project_template`, which will be renamed when you create a new repository from this template.

```

## Requirements

- Only [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) and
    - Node.js and npm, for semantic-release and package publishing.

You can install uv following the instructions in the [documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

## Python Installation

You can install and handle Python versions with uv:

```bash
uv python install 3.12
uv python pin 3.12
uv python list
```

## Creating a Project from this Template

1. Create a new repository from this template on GitHub.

2. Let the initialization workflow run.

   The `.github/workflows/init.yml` workflow runs automatically on `main` or
   `master` when the repository is not marked as a template. It calls
   `rename-template.sh` to replace the template placeholders with the repository
   name, removes the initialization workflow, and commits the result.

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

4. Run the checks:

    ```bash
    uv run poe static-checks
    uv run poe format-check
    uv run poe test
    ```

5. Start building your project in `src/uv_python_project_template/` and add tests under
   `test/`.

## Main Commands

### Running the Application
`uv run uv_python_project_template` to run the application entry point defined in `pyproject.toml`.


### Dependency Management

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `uv sync` | Create or update the local environment from `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`. |
| `uv run uv_python_project_template` | Run the application entry point. |
| `uv add <package>` | Add a runtime dependency. |
| `uv add --dev <package>` | Add a development dependency. |
| `uv remove <package>` | Remove a dependency. | 
| `uv lock` | Update the lock file after dependency changes. |
| `uv sync --locked` | Sync the environment strictly to the locked versions. |

### Configured Tasks

Project task aliases are defined in [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) under `[tool.poe.tasks]` and
can be run through uv.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `uv run poe test` | Run the pytest test suite. |
| `uv run poe coverage` | Run tests through coverage. |
| `uv run poe coverage-report` | Print a terminal coverage report with missing lines. |
| `uv run poe coverage-html` | Generate an HTML coverage report in `htmlcov/`. |
| `uv run poe ruff-check` | Run Ruff lint checks. |
| `uv run poe ruff-fix` | Run Ruff and apply automatic fixes. |
| `uv run poe format` | Format code with Ruff. |
| `uv run poe format-check` | Check formatting without changing files. |
| `uv run poe mypy` | Type-check `src/` and `test/` with Mypy. |
| `uv run poe compile` | Compile `src/` and `test/` to catch syntax errors. |
| `uv run poe static-checks` | Run the configured static checks, currently Ruff and Mypy. |


## Release a new version on PyPi

New versions are automatically released on PyPi via GitHub Actions, when a push is made on the `main` or `master` branch.

The version number is updated automatically by the `semantic-release` tool, which uses the commit messages to infer the type of the release (major, minor, patch).

It is paramount that the commit messages follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification,
in order for `semantic-release` to compute version numbers correctly.


For successfully publishing, configure these repository secrets as needed:

- `PYPI_TOKEN`: token for publishing to PyPI.
- `TEST_PYPI_TOKEN`: token for publishing to TestPyPI.
- `RELEASE_TOKEN`: GitHub token used by semantic-release.

The workflow dry-runs releases outside `main` or `master`, and also dry-runs the
initial commit.

## Automatic updates of dependencies (via Renovate)

The project is configured to use [Renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com/) to automatically open pull-requests
to update dependencies declared in `pyproject.toml`.

By default, Renovate will assign such pull-requests to the user who created the repository from this template.

If the project has tests (which is the case for this template), Renovate will only merge such pull-requests
if all tests pass.

When some test fails, Renovate will leave a comment on the pull-request, so that you can fix the issue manually.

To make Renovate work, you need to enable it for your repository.
To do so, please follow the instruction at <https://docs.renovatebot.com/getting-started/installing-onboarding/#hosted-githubcom-app>

Finally, please remember to enable PR auto-merging in your repository settings, otherwise Renovate will not be able to merge
the pull-requests it opens, even if all tests pass.
To do so, please follow the instructions available [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/managing-auto-merge-for-pull-requests-in-your-repository#managing-auto-merge).

> Notice that the combination between Renovate, and Semantic Release may lead to a number of releases being created automatically.
